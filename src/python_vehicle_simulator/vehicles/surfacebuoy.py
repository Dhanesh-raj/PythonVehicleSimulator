buoyDynamics.py:

   Class for a generic surface buoy parametrized using its main dimensions and characteristics. 
   This model considers buoy motion in response to wave and current forces.
       
   buoyDynamics()
       Simulates buoy response to environmental forces (wave, current)
       
   buoyDynamics('waveResponse', waveHeight, wavePeriod, currentSpeed, currentDirection)
        waveHeight: height of the wave (m)
        wavePeriod: period of the wave (s)
        currentSpeed: speed of the ocean current (m/s)
        currentDirection: direction of the ocean current (degrees from north)

Methods:
        
    [eta,nu] = dynamics(eta, nu, waveForce, currentForce, sampleTime) 
        Integrate the buoy's equations of motion. waveForce and currentForce are 
        environmental forces acting on the buoy.

    waveForce = calculateWaveForce(waveHeight, wavePeriod)
        Calculates the force exerted by waves on the buoy.

    currentForce = calculateCurrentForce(currentSpeed, currentDirection)
        Calculates the force exerted by ocean currents on the buoy.

    Relevant literature on buoy dynamics and environmental modeling.
